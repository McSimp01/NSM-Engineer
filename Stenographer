{
    "Threads": [
      { "PacketsDirectory": "/path/to/thread0/packets/directory"
      , "IndexDirectory": "/path/to/thread0/index/directory"
      , "MaxDirectoryFiles": 30000
      , "DiskFreePercentage": 10
      }
    ]
    , "StenotypePath": "/usr/bin/stenotype"
    , "Interface": "em1"
    , "Port": 1234
    , "Host": "127.0.0.1"
    , "Flags": []

  ```
12. Change packets directory to ""/data/stenographer/packets"
13. change index to "/data/stenographer/index"
14. Max directory files, leave as is, this is the number that steno uses before it starts writing over
15. Disk free percentage is the buffer
16. sudo which stenographer
17. /bin/stenotype should be the answer which is what you put in the stenotype path
18. change interfce to enps50
19. sudo mkdir /data/stenographer/packets
20. sudo mkdir /data/stenographer/index
21. cd /data/stenographer
22. ll to verify index and packets were created
23. need to change the permissions for SElinux
24. sudo chown -R stenographer:stenographer /data/stenographer
25. ll to verify
26. now we are going to create steno keys
27. sudo stenokeys.sh stenogrpaher stenographer

29. sudo systemctl start stenographer
30. sudo systemctl status stenographer
