# **Setting up the Sensor**
## **Intel Nuc**
---
### Steps
1. Power on and F10
2. UEFI : USB : General : Part 1 : OS Boot loader
3. Test the media first for good measure
4. Select your language
5. Network and Hostname
6. Set up two interfaces, one for MGMT and one for sniffing
7. Right is MGMT and the left is sniffing (looking at it from the back)
8. MGMT is eno1
9. Connect an ethernet from the MGMT port to the LAN port on your PFSense
10. Flip the switch on the top right of eno1 to 'on'
11. Click 'configure'
12. IPv4 Settings
13. Method: Manual
14. Under addresses, type your sensor IP: 172.16.x0.100
15. 255.255.255.0 for the Netmask
16. Gateway will be your PFSense IP: 172.16.x0.1
17. Go over to IPv6 Settings, under method, hit ignore
18. Click 'save'
19. Bottom left corner change hostname to SG-x0.local.lan
20. Click 'done'
21. Go to 'Date and Time'
22. Region 'ETC'
23. Under city, it is coordinated universal time
24. Make sure Network Time on the top right is on as well
25. click 'done'
26. Under software selection, there should be a subscript of "minimal install"
27. Disable KDUMP, dont need the extra data on our system
28. **Installation Destination**
29. Should be 2 disks, we are selecting both. We want to blow them away
30. One for data partition and one for OS is the goal
31. Check automatically configure partitionining
32. Select I would like to make additional space available
33. Click done
34. Select 'delete all'
35. Then select 'reclaim space'
36. Go back into installation destination and create your own partitions
37. Check 'I will configure partitioning'
38. Keep 'I would like to make additional space available' checked
39. Select 'Done'
40. Select hyperlink 'Click here to create them automatically'
41. Should be seeing your partitions
42. Select /home
43. Change desired capacity to 1G
44. Select 'Update Settings' (should convert to 1024)
45. do the same for the root directory
46. We are doing this to reclaim the space
47. Going to add another partition
48. We are adding /var/log
49. Select + icon and label the partition as so
50. Capacity should be 1 G
51. Select 'Add Mount Point'
52. going to add a couple more partitions
53. add /tmp
54. /var
55. /var/log/audit
56. /var/tmp
57. /data/stenographer (because steno writes to disk )
58. /data/suricata (because suricata writes to disk )
59. /data/kafka (because kafka writes to disk )
60. /data/elasticsearch (because elasticsearch writes to disk )
61. /data/zeek (because zeek writes to disk )
62. Normally Zeek goes through Kafka but for this class we are going to show it writing to disk
63. /data/fsf (because fsf writes to disk )
64. We want to separate our operating systems tools from our data tools
65. select root
66. volume group > create a new volume group
67. select the smaller disk, 500 gigs
68. Name it VG_OS
69. select 'save'
70. select 'update'
71. Anything that doesnt say data is going to be a VG_OS
72. | VG_OS | /tmp [5 G] | /var [50G] | /var/log [50G] | /var/log/audit [50G] | /var/tmp [10G] | /home [50G] | swap [4G] | / [blank] |
73. | VG_Data | /data/stenographer [500G] | /data/suricata [25G] | /data/kafka [100G] | /data/zeek [25G] | /data/fsf [10G] | /data/elasticsearch [blank]
74. under /data/zeek, create new volume group
75. 1TB
76. VG_data
77. add VG_data to all the sections above
78. go through and adjust the desired capacity for each section listed above from the 1024
79. **dont touch the /boot drives**
80. Do the elasticsearch and / drives last because they are left blank meaing they will take whatever space is left
81. Should be around 5805 KiB left over
82. the eve.json file from suricata gets moved permanently to elasticsearch which is why we dont give it that much space
83. Steno has a lot of space due to pcaps
84. Kafka has a lot to give log stash time to catch up
85. once you verify the mount points, click done
86. accept the changes when you click done
87. when we click begin installation and then you create user
88. **this is time sensitive so move fast!**
89. call the user admin // password simple
90. If you dont fill it out in time, then you will not have an admin
91. Select 'reboot'
92. make sure to take the centOS flashdrive out though
93. log in with your user credentials once it is back up in the terminal
94. 'ip a' to verify your IP and the eno1 you just set up
95. now ssh into your sensor from your laptop to check if its on
96. ssh <username>@IP
97. validate the network script for the mgmt interface
98. sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eno1
99. change all the IPv6 to 'no'
100. sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf
101. add a line that says 'net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1'
102. next line says 'net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1'
103. going to host file 'sudo vi /etc/hosts'
104. either comment or delete the line that starts with "::"
105. 'sudo sysctl -p' to reload and restart the system to force the changes
