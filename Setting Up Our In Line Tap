# Setting Up Our In Line Tap
---

1. ip a
2. enp5s0 -- interface on the sensor will be our permiscuous port
3. Disable NIC OFFloading to get the most raw data for Zeek
4. sudo ethtool -k enp5s0
5. **We are gonna run a script to turn off as much as we can off**
6. curl -LO https://192.168.2.20:8080/interface_prep.sh
7. make sure you curl this to the home directory (so cd)
8. 'll' to verify your interface is in your home directory
9. 'alias 'll='ls -l'
10. cat interface_prep.sh
11. **script turns all off and turns promiscuous on**
12. sudo chmod +x interface_prep.sh
13. **above command makes it an executable**
14. 'll' to verify in the permissions that it is an executable
15. sudo ./interface_prep.sh enp5s0
16. watch how all the options are turned off by running this script
17. sudo ethtool -K enp5s0
18. above command is just another way to verify
19. Edit the ifup-local script since CentOS checks it everytime we boot up
20. Need to be in the /sbin directory before we curl
21. curl -LlO http://192.168.2.20:8080/ifup-local
22. 'sudo !!' this will replace the previous command with sudo before
23. cat ifup-local (fairly similar to the previous script)
24. **script adds our sniffing interface**
25. sudo chmod +x ifup-local
26. 'll ifup-local' to verify
27. **Another file to configure in /etc**
28. cd into /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup
29. not a directory, so go up to network-scripts
30. sudo vi ifup
31. **add an entry to call up the ifup-local file**
32. add entry at the bottom
33. '''
        if [ -x /sbin/ifup-local ]; then
          /sbin/ifup-local ${DEVICE}
        fi
    '''
34. **create a network script for en5sp0**
35. sudo vi ifcfg-enp5s0
36. BOOTPROTO = none
37. IPv^6 = no
38. DEFROUTE = none
39. Make sure the device is the same as enp5s0
40. ONBOOT = yes
41. add a line 'NM_CONTROLLED=no'
42. UUID will always be different with a NIC
43. sudo systemctl reboot
44. SSH back after waiting a min
45. use eth tool to verify
46. sudo ethtool -k enp5s0
47. checksumming is marked as OFF? good.
48. ip a to verify the interface is marked as PROMISC

## Power Point Notes
- set up the in line tap to the monitor port ON THE IN LINE TAP
- take out the MGMT connection from the PFSENSE that is connected into the MGMT on the NUC and plug it into the port 1 of the tap
- connect the pfsense to the tap
- port 2 on in line tap to lan 2 on pfsense
- validate traffic ingest
- install tcpdump or have it
- cd /etc/yum.repos.d
- ll
- sudo yum install tcpdump --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=local*
- above command is only wanting to pull from our local repo
- no centos, you can just do sudo yum install tcpdump
- sudo yum list tcpdump
- tcpdump -i enp5s0
- tcpdump -nn -i enp5s0
- sudo tcpdump -nn -i enp5s0 -c4
- sudo tcpdump -nn -c5 -i enp5s0 '!port 22'
- curl 8.8.8.8 to generate traffic (in a separate terminal)
